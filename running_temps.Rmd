## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
source("code/0-packages.R")
source("code/0b-ggplothelpers.R")
source("code/2-functions.R")

```


```{r}


ggplot(air_tempsoutput, aes(x=fahr, y=celsius, fill=kelvin)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.7, shape = 21) +
  labs(x = "fahrenheit")+
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = rev(c("#f94144","#f3722c","#f8961e", "#f9c74f","#90be6d","#43aa8b","#4d908e","#577590","#277da1")))+
  custom_theme(14)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
